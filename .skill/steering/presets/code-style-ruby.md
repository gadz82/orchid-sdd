summary: RuboCop, a type checker where adopted, and explicit failure handling.

# Rule

Ruby code must pass the project’s RuboCop configuration and its test suite. Where the project
uses Sorbet or Steep, type checking must pass at the configured strictness. Prefer explicit
objects and methods over `method_missing`, global state, or broad rescue clauses.

# Checks

- RuboCop passes on changed files.
- The type checker, where configured, passes.
- Tests cover failure paths and boundary conditions.
- Exceptions are specific and rescued only where handled.
- Metaprogramming has a clear owner and a test.
- New inline suppressions have a reason and an owner.
- Framework concerns stay outside domain objects.

# Evidence

Attach the exact RuboCop, type-checker, and test commands and results to the prompt report and
logic-review checklist.
