# Rule

The SonarQube quality gate is the source of truth for static analysis. New code must not add
blocking issues, security hotspots, or uncovered branches beyond the project threshold. The
quality gate must run on the integration result, not only on an implementer’s local branch.

# Checks

- The quality-gate command or scanner is recorded and reproducible.
- New violations are zero for the project’s blocking severities.
- Coverage and duplication thresholds are evaluated for new code.
- `NOSONAR` and exclusions are reviewed and owned.
- Security hotspots have a disposition, not a silent dismissal.

# Evidence

Attach the quality-gate result, project key, branch/revision, and scan timestamp to the prompt
report and the logic-review checklist.
